%{
function [means, errorBars] = findMI_KSG_bias_kN(X,Y,listOfKs, listSplitSizes, do_plot, do_plot_stddev, do_plot_subsampling)

uses KSG k-nearest neighbors mutual information estimator at various values
of k, allowing to select the best k

X,Y - continuous 1-d variables - should each be given as vectors. These
*must* be the same length as each other

listOfKs - vector of integers, the list of different values of k in the 
k-nearest neighbors KSG estimator to try. 

listSplitSizes - list of paritioning of the data to be used for errror bars
calculations; see detailed description in findMI_KSG_subsampling.m 

means - values of estimated I(X;Y), in bits, at each k value in listOfKs.
Vector of the same dimension as listOfKs.

errorBars - errors for the estimated values of I(X;Y) at each k, in bits.
Vector of the same dimension as listOfKs.

do_plot - binary scalar. If 1, plots of dependence of MI estimated values 
on k will automatically be generated.

do_plot_stddev, do_plot_subsampling -- binary scalars, are passed directly 
to findMI_KSG_stddev and findMI_KSG_subsampling and control generation of
figures in these function; see documentation for these function

                    %information at each k, buts

N = length(X);      %We do not check that X and Y are of the same size; 
        % this is done by MIxnyn

for i = 1:length(listOfKs) %for each k value, find the values of the information and the error estimates
